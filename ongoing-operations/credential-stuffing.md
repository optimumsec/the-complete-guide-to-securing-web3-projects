## Protect Against Credential Stuffing and Account Takeovers

### Description
Credential stuffing occurs when attackers **use stolen usernames and passwords**—often from unrelated data breaches—to gain unauthorized access to accounts. In Web3, this typically targets **project admin accounts**, including email, hosting, cloud services, and social media. Once access is obtained, attackers can manipulate websites, post malicious links, or steal funds.  

This attack exploits **password reuse and weak security practices**, making it a low-effort but high-reward method for attackers.

### Why It’s Common in Web3
- **Password Reuse**: Team members may reuse passwords across multiple platforms, increasing exposure when any site is breached.  
- **Weak Security Practices**: Lack of hardware security keys, poor password management, and minimal account monitoring make credential stuffing easier.  
- **High Impact**: Admin accounts provide access to sensitive project infrastructure, making them a prime target.  

### Impact
- **Website Compromise**: Attackers can modify project websites to redirect users to phishing or scam pages.  
- **Financial Loss**: Access to wallets, treasury systems, or token sales can result in direct theft.  
- **Community Trust Damage**: Unauthorized posts or malicious updates erode confidence in the project.  
- **Operational Disruption**: Teams must spend critical time restoring compromised accounts and mitigating damage.  

### Real-World Examples
- **Web3 Project Website Takeovers**: Compromised admin email accounts have led to attackers altering official project websites, redirecting users to phishing or scam sites, and sometimes draining connected wallets.  
- **Decentralized Exchange Admin Breaches**: In some cases, compromised cloud credentials allowed attackers to temporarily modify front-end content, tricking users into signing malicious transactions.  


### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Strong Authentication
- **Use Hardware Security Keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)** for all critical accounts (email, cloud, social media, hosting).  
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever possible, avoiding SMS-based 2FA.  

#### 2. Password Hygiene
- **Unique, Complex Passwords** for every account.  
- **Password Managers** to generate and securely store credentials.  
- **Regular Rotation** of passwords for critical systems and services.  

#### 3. Monitoring and Alerts
- **Login Monitoring**: Enable alerts for suspicious logins or failed login attempts.  
- **Audit Logs**: Regularly review admin account activity and changes to sensitive systems.  
- **Third-Party Breach Monitoring**: Track compromised credentials using services like Have I Been Pwned.  

#### 4. Access Control
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Limit admin access to only the accounts and systems necessary.  
- **Segregation of Duties**: Different team members handle separate critical systems to reduce risk of full takeover.  
- **Immediate Offboarding**: Revoke access for departing team members promptly.  

#### 5. Incident Response
- **Account Lockdown**: Immediately secure or disable compromised accounts.  
- **Password & Key Rotation**: Change passwords and rotate keys for all affected systems.  
- **Community Communication**: Inform users of potential risks if website content or communications were altered.  
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Determine the breach vector and prevent future recurrence.  


### Summary
Credential stuffing and account takeovers are **high-risk attacks for Web3 projects**, exploiting reused or weak credentials to compromise admin accounts. By implementing **hardware-backed authentication, strong password practices, monitoring, and strict access controls**, projects can drastically reduce exposure and maintain both security and user trust.

## Conduct a Web3SOC-Style Review

### Overview

A Web3SOC-style review evaluates your protocol's readiness for institutional interactions and identifies potential risks before deployment. Cantina pioneered the [Web3SOC framework](https://cantina.xyz/web3soc), but this guide focuses on internal implementation to ensure high standards of security, governance, and operational maturity.

### Objectives

### Audit Scope

#### 1. Governance

- Assess community engagement and transparency mechanisms.

#### 2. Security

## Protect Against SIM Swapping

### Description
SIM swapping is a form of **identity theft** where attackers convince mobile carriers to transfer a victim’s phone number to a new SIM card under their control. This enables them to intercept **two-factor authentication (2FA) codes**, reset account passwords, and gain unauthorized access to various services, including email, social media, and cryptocurrency exchanges.

In the context of Web3, SIM swapping poses significant risks to both individual users and project teams.

### Why It’s Common in Web3
- **SMS-Based 2FA**: Many Web3 projects and users still rely on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks.
- **High-Profile Targets**: Developers, admins, and influencers are prime targets due to their access to critical accounts and platforms.
- **Lack of Awareness**: The decentralized nature of Web3 can lead to inconsistent security practices among its participants.

### Impact
- **Account Takeovers**: Attackers can hijack social media accounts to post fraudulent announcements or phishing links.
- **Financial Losses**: Access to crypto wallets can lead to significant thefts.
- **Reputational Damage**: Compromised accounts can spread misinformation, eroding trust in the affected project.

### Real-World Examples
- **Gutter Cat Gang NFT Collection**: In July 2023, the co-founder of the Gutter Cat Gang NFT project had their Twitter account compromised through a SIM swap. The attacker posted fake links to limited edition NFT sneaker airdrops, leading to users' wallets being drained.
- **Michael Terpin**: In 2017, entrepreneur Michael Terpin was a victim of a SIM swap attack that resulted in the theft of $23.8 million worth of cryptocurrency. The attackers bribed an AT&T employee to facilitate the SIM swap.
- **FTX Heist**: In November 2022, during the bankruptcy proceedings of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, over $400 million worth of crypto was stolen. The U.S. Department of Justice indicted three individuals for orchestrating a massive SIM-swapping theft ring, allegedly responsible for the FTX heist.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Avoid SMS 2FA**: Use hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn) instead of SMS-based authentication.
- **Secure Accounts**: Ensure email, social media, and exchange accounts have strong, unique passwords and hardware-backed 2FA.
- **Carrier Security**: Add extra PINs or passcodes with mobile carriers to prevent unauthorized SIM changes.
- **Monitor Accounts**: Regularly check for unusual login attempts and act immediately on suspicious activity.
- **User Education**: Train team members and users about SIM swapping risks and safe 2FA practices.

### Summary
SIM swapping is a high-risk attack in Web3 targeting both **users and project admins**. Compromised phone numbers can lead to account takeovers, stolen funds, and reputational damage. **Mitigation relies on using hardware-backed authentication, securing accounts, and monitoring for suspicious activity.**

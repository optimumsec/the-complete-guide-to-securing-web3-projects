## Background Checks and Personnel Security for Web3 Projects

With the global rise of remote work, **malicious actors have increasingly targeted Web3 projects by infiltrating teams directly**. Unlike purely external attacks, insider threats are uniquely dangerous—attackers may gain access to codebases, deployment keys, and sensitive infrastructure. To minimize these risks, projects must adopt **background checks and structured personnel security measures** as part of their overall security posture.


### Why Insider Threats Matter  
- **Privileged access**: Developers, DevOps engineers, and auditors often handle critical secrets.  
- **Difficulty of detection**: Malicious intent may only surface after weeks or months of participation.  
- **Long-term consequences**: A compromised insider can push malicious code, leak private data, or delay vulnerability disclosures.  


### Recommended Measures  

#### 1. Background Checks  
- **Identity Verification**: Require government-issued ID verification for core contributors.  
- **Work History Validation**: Confirm past roles, projects, and references.  
- **Reputation Screening**: Check open-source contributions, community involvement, and potential red flags.  

> ⚠️ Background checks should respect privacy and comply with relevant laws (e.g., GDPR).


#### 2. Access Control & Principle of Least Privilege  
- Grant access strictly on a **need-to-know basis**.  
- Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** for repositories, servers, and cloud services.  
- Regularly review and revoke unused or outdated permissions.  


#### 3. Segregation of Duties  
- Separate responsibilities for development, auditing, and deployment.  
- Require **multi-party approvals** for critical actions like contract deployment or treasury transactions.  
- Rotate roles periodically to reduce reliance on a single individual.  


#### 4. Security Onboarding & Offboarding  
- **Onboarding**: Provide clear guidelines on handling secrets, communication tools, and reporting suspicious activity.  
- **Offboarding**: Immediately revoke access when contributors leave. Audit credentials, keys, and repository memberships.  


#### 5. Monitoring and Detection  
- Enable audit logs for GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure.  
- Monitor for anomalous activity such as unusual commit patterns, mass data access, or sudden privilege escalations.  
- Use automated alerts for sensitive actions.  


#### 6. Cultural and Legal Safeguards  
- Establish a **code of conduct** that emphasizes security and trust.  
- Use **NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements)** and contributor agreements to protect proprietary knowledge.  
- Encourage a culture where **reporting suspicious behavior** is normalized and rewarded.

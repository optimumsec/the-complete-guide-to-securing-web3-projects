## Use Cryptographic Libraries

In Solidity, verifying signatures is a crucial part of ensuring that only authorized parties can perform specific actions in a smart contract. Instead of writing custom signature verification logic, developers should rely on well-established [cryptography libraries](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/utils/cryptography).

These libraries have been thoroughly tested and are less likely to contain critical bugs that could lead to exploits, such as unauthorized access or fraudulent transactions. Issues around `ecrecover`, like signature malleability or improper error handling, as well as potential integration bugs with ERC-1271 signatures, are also addressed by these libraries.

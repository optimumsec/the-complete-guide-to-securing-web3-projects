## Use A Plugin For Safe Upgrades
When setting up a proxy for a contract, there are specific restrictions concerning the contract's code. Notably, the contract mustn't include a constructor, and it's advised to steer clear of utilizing operations like selfdestruct or delegatecall due to security considerations. It is highly recommended to use a [plugin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/) that ensures the newly introduced contract complies with the safe upgrades rules.

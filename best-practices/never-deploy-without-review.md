## Never Deploy Code That Was Not Reviewed Externally
External code reviews are essential because they provide an unbiased, fresh perspective, often uncovering vulnerabilities or flaws that internal teams may overlook due to familiarity with the code. Third-party auditors bring expertise, diverse experiences, and specialized tools to identify security risks, logical errors, and compliance issues. In the context of smart contracts, where flaws can lead to significant financial losses, relying solely on internal review is insufficient. A rigorous, external review ensures that the code adheres to best practices and industry standards, mitigating the risk of exploits, bugs, or unintended behaviors.

## Establish a Contingency Plan

A contingency plan for smart contracts is a predefined strategy to mitigate risks and respond effectively to unexpected events or failures. Since smart contracts are often immutable and handle significant financial value, contingency plans help address scenarios such as bugs, security breaches, or external disruptions.

These plans may include mechanisms like pausable contracts, multi-signature controls, emergency withdrawal features, or upgrade paths. A robust contingency plan ensures that project teams can protect users and assets while minimizing downtime and reputational damage in crisis situations.

A robust contingency plan should include the following: 

### 1. Risk Assessment and Scenario Planning
- **Identify Critical Components**: Highlight the most sensitive parts of the smart contract, such as fund-handling logic or external integrations (e.g., oracles).  
- **Anticipate Failure Scenarios**: Include scenarios like reentrancy attacks, front-running, oracle manipulation, and unexpected user behaviors.  
- **Define Potential Impact**: For each scenario, estimate the financial, reputational, and operational impact.  

### 2. Incident Detection and Monitoring
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to track unusual activities, such as large withdrawals, unexpected function calls, interactions from suspicious addresses and/or closed source contracts.  
- **Alerting Systems**: Set up automated alerts for anomalies that could indicate a security breach.  

### 3. Emergency Response Mechanisms
- **Pause/Stop Functionality**: Include mechanisms like circuit breakers or pause functions to halt operations in case of suspicious activities or detected vulnerabilities.  
- **Upgradability**: If feasible, utilize proxy patterns or modular contracts to enable patching without redeploying.  

### 4. Establish an Incident Response Team  
- **Leadership:** The [Chief of Security](./chief-of-security.md) should lead the incident response team, ensuring clear direction and accountability.  
- **Core Members:** Include key personnel such as developers, security researchers, community representatives, and legal advisors.  
- **Security Council Involvement:** The [Security Council](./security-council.md) should be an integral part of the team, offering expertise and decision-making authority for critical situations.  
- **Role Assignments:** Clearly define responsibilities such as incident commander, communication lead, and technical responders.  

### 5. Access Control and Emergency Governance
- **Multi-Signature Schemes**: Require multiple trusted parties to approve critical actions, such as pausing the contract or migrating funds.  
- **Emergency Committees**: Establish a governance structure for making urgent decisions. This could include key team members, external advisors, or even community stakeholders.  
- **Role Definitions**: Clearly define roles and responsibilities for handling incidents, including developers, auditors, and communication leads.  

### 6. Fund Recovery Strategies
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Design contracts with withdrawal limits or time locks to reduce the risk of immediate loss.  
- **Backup Wallets**: Maintain secure backup wallets to migrate funds in case of compromised contracts.  

### 7. Communication Plan
- **Internal Communication**: Ensure all team members are informed and can act quickly during an incident.  
- **External Communication**: Prepare templates for public disclosures to inform users, stakeholders, and the community about the issue and steps being taken to resolve it.  
- **Legal and Compliance Considerations**: Work with legal advisors to handle potential liabilities or regulatory reporting.  

### 8. Testing and Drills
- **Simulated Attacks**: Periodically test the contingency plan through red teaming or other simulated attack exercises.  
- **Role-Playing Drills**: Conduct drills to ensure all team members are familiar with their roles during an emergency.  

### 9. Post-Incident Review and Improvements
- **Incident Analysis**: After resolving an issue, analyze the root cause and the effectiveness of the response.  
- **Audit and Update**: Regularly review and update the contingency plan based on lessons learned and evolving security practices.

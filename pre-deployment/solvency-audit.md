## Conduct a Solvency Assurance Audit

### Overview  
A **Solvency Assurance Audit** evaluates whether a protocol's balance sheet and liquidation mechanisms can withstand shocks—ensuring the system remains solvent and able to honor obligations even under stress.

### Why Solvency Assurance Is Critical  
Code and parameter safety alone don't guarantee viability. Protocols must also demonstrate that:
- **Assets ≥ Liabilities** under adverse conditions  
- Liquidation mechanisms can act effectively and fast enough to preserve solvency

### Pre-Audit Preparation  
- **Clearly define scope**: Identify pools, collateral types, leverage thresholds, and liquidity concentrations. Make assumptions explicit.  
- **Run internal dry-runs**: Perform initial solvency checks before engaging external auditors.  
- **Test coverage**: Prioritize fork-level and stress simulations, including edge-case modeling and fuzzed inputs.

### Audit Process and Components

#### 1. Balance Sheet Analysis  
- Evaluate total assets (collateral, reserves) vs. liabilities (outstanding debt, redemption obligations).  
- Identify **exposure concentrations** (e.g., collateral concentration in a volatile asset).

#### 2. Stress Testing Scenarios  
- Simulate severe events:
  - Rapid price crashes (e.g., 50% drop in ETH in 24 hrs).  
  - Liquidity shortages.  
  - Correlated multi-asset failures.

#### 3. Liquidation & Liquidity Dynamics  
- Stress test liquidation execution paths, focusing on:
  - Market depth limitations.
  - Time-to-liquidate vs. price decay.
  - Slippage and cascading risk effects.

#### 4. Risk Metrics  
- **Solvency ratios** under stress.  
- **Liquidation capacity**: how much collateral can be offloaded before breaching solvency.  
- Early-warning indicators for escalating risk.

#### 5. Deliverables  
- **Solvency health report** with scenario analyses.  
- **Recommendations** for:
  - Improved collateral diversification.
  - Adjusted liquidation thresholds or incentives.
  - Buffer reserves or liquidity backstops.

### Post-Audit Actions  
1. **Test regression scenarios** — Ensure recommended changes fix the issues and prevent recurrence.  
2. **Allocate buffer time** — Allow for testing, governance discussion, and revalidation.  
3. **Update documentation** — Reflect all modifications, including new risk thresholds or monitoring protocols.  
4. **Execute testnet trials** — Simulate the audit recommendations under realistic conditions.

## The Importance of Code Freeze Before Deployment

A code freeze before deployment is a pivotal step to safeguard security and ensure the integrity of the project.
This freeze should occur **only after** all identified issues from the security audit have been thoroughly addressed and verified, not just by the development team but also by the auditors who initially flagged them.

This practice ensures that no new vulnerabilities are introduced during the final stages of preparation and that the reviewed fixes are properly integrated.

For immutable and highly sensitive systems like smart contracts, where post-deployment changes are often impractical or impossible, a code freeze provides a stable and vetted codebase for deployment. It creates a critical checkpoint, allowing teams to focus on deployment logistics and security hardening, reducing the risk of **last-minute errors** that could compromise the project or lead to significant financial losses.

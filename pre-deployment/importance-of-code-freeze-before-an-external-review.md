## The Importance of Code Freeze Before an External Security Review

Implementing a code freeze before an external security review is a critical step in the development of smart contracts, as it ensures that the codebase remains stable and unchanged during the audit process. This practice prevents new vulnerabilities from being introduced after the review begins, maintaining the integrity of the assessment.

For smart contracts, where security flaws can lead to irreversible financial losses, a code freeze helps auditors focus on a fixed and well-understood codebase. It also eliminates the risk of miscommunication or oversight that might occur if changes are made during the audit.

By freezing the code, teams provide external reviewers with the assurance that their findings will remain relevant and actionable, ultimately leading to a more thorough and reliable security evaluation.

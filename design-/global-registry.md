## Global Registry for Project Deployed Smart Contracts

### Introduction
A **Global Registry Contract** is a central contract that tracks all deployed contracts within a project. It ensures secure interactions between contracts while enforcing structured access control. Every deployed contract should store the registry’s address and use it to validate interactions.

#### Why Use a Global Registry?
- ✅ **Efficient Tracking:** Maintain a single source of truth for deployed contracts.
- 🔐 **Access Control:** Securely manage contract interactions.
- 📂 **Role-Based Grouping:** Aggregate contract instances into structured roles.
- 📉 **Eliminate Redundancy:** Reduce storage costs by keeping addresses in a single registry instead of multiple contracts.

### Benefits
#### 🔑 Security & Access Control
- Contracts can verify interactions based on registered roles.
- Reduces unauthorized access and contract misuse.

#### 🛠️ Storage Efficiency
- Prevents multiple contracts from storing redundant addresses.
- Saves gas costs by centralizing contract reference data.

### Design Considerations
#### 📌 Registry Reference in Every Contract
Each deployed contract should store the **registry address** for validation.

#### 🗂️ Key-Value Storage
- Contracts are stored using a **key** (contract name + unique identifier) and a **value** (contract address).

#### 👥 Role-Based Access Control
- The registry groups contract instances under **roles**, allowing multiple instances of the same contract to interact securely.

#### 👨‍💼 Ownership & Management
- Define **who** can register contracts and assign roles (admin, DAO governance, etc.).

## Gradually Transition to Immutability  

Achieving perfect, bug-free smart contracts at launch is nearly impossible. Instead, treat **immutability** as a **gradual process**, building resilience through extensive testing, community review, and real-world use.  

By starting with upgradeable contracts and gradually transitioning key components to immutability, you can ensure a balance between security and adaptability as your system matures.

### Why Gradual Immutability?  
- **Flexibility:** Allows for fixes and improvements in the early stages.  
- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduces the impact of unforeseen vulnerabilities.  
- **Progressive Security:** Confidence in the code grows over time as it is battle-tested.

### Staged Approach to Immutability  

1. **Start with Upgradeable Contracts**  
   - Design most contracts to be upgradeable at launch, especially those with:  
     - Complex or novel logic.  
     - Dependencies on other upgradeable components.  
     - Frequent interactions with external systems.  

2. **Identify Candidates for Immutability**  
   - Mature contracts with:  
     - Simple, self-contained logic.  
     - Code derived from trusted libraries.  
     - Extensive audits and real-world use.  

3. **Transition Gradually**  
   - As confidence builds, evaluate contracts for immutability using these factors:  
     - **Code Maturity:** Proven stability over time.  
     - **Usage:** Widespread adoption and testing by the community.  
     - **Isolation:** Minimal interaction with upgradeable components.

### Examples  

#### 1. **Good Candidate for Immutability**  
- **Token Contracts:** Based on trusted libraries like OpenZeppelin and with self-contained logic.  

#### 2. **Better Suited for Upgradeability**  
- **New AMM Models:** Complex or experimental algorithms that may require adjustments post-deployment.

### Best Practices  

- **Leverage a Security Council:** Regularly assess which components are ready to transition to immutability.  
- **Audit Thoroughly:** Ensure each contract has undergone rigorous testing and review before making it immutable.  
- **Document the Process:** Maintain a clear record of which components are upgradeable and which are immutable.

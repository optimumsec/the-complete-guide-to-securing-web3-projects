## Handling a Security Incident  

When a security issue arises, **swift and organized action** is essential to minimize damage and maintain user trust. A well-prepared [**contingency plan**](./establish-contingency-plan.md), defined in advance, should guide your response to ensure consistency and efficiency.

 Follow these steps to effectively manage a security incident:

### 1. Analyze the Incident  
- **Identify the Scope:** Determine the root cause, affected contracts, and the extent of the vulnerability.  
- **Consult Experts:** Bring in external security researchers if necessary to assist in the analysis.  

### 2. Contain the Damage  
- **Pause Operations:** Use pause mechanisms to halt withdrawals, trading, or other critical functionalities.  
- **Secure Funds:** Transfer vulnerable assets to a secure address or multisig wallet to protect user funds.  

### 3. Communicate Transparently  
- **Notify Users:** Issue a concise and clear public statement acknowledging the issue, ensuring users understand the safety of their funds is a priority.  
- **Status Updates:** Regularly update users on the progress of mitigation efforts and expected timelines for resolution.  

### 4. Patch and Test Fixes  
- **Develop a Fix:** Quickly create a patch to address the vulnerability.  
- **Test on Testnets:** Simulate real-world scenarios to validate the fix without introducing new issues.  
- **Audit the Fix:** Have security researchers review the fix independently before deployment.  

### 5. Migrate Data if Needed  
- **Assess Data State:** Determine if the issue has affected the integrity or accuracy of stored data.  
- **Plan Data Updates:** Develop scripts or processes to repair or migrate affected data.  
- **Validate Migration:** Thoroughly test data migration scripts on a testnet to confirm correctness and prevent additional errors.  

### 6. Redeploy and Resume Operations  
- **Roll Out Incrementally:** Deploy the patched version in stages, starting with non-critical systems to monitor its behavior.  
- **Unpause Safely:** Resume operations only after verifying that the issue has been fully resolved.

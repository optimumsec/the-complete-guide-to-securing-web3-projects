## Adopt a “Soft Launch” Strategy

Launching a decentralized application (dApp) can be a high-stakes process, as any vulnerabilities or flaws could have significant financial and reputational consequences. A "soft launch" involves releasing the dApp in a controlled manner to mitigate risks and ensure robust security. Below is a guide on how to execute a soft launch effectively.

### Why Soft Launch?
1. **Mitigate Risks**: Reduce the impact of potential vulnerabilities or exploits.
2. **System Stress Testing**: Test the system under real-world conditions with limited exposure.
3. **Incremental Trust Building**: Gradually build trust with users as the dApp demonstrates reliability.

### Steps for a Soft Launch

1. **Limit Functionality**
   - Start with core features only, leaving more complex or less critical functionalities inactive.
   - Example: Allow users to deposit funds into the platform but disable withdrawals temporarily.

2. **Cap Funds and Transactions**
   - **Set Transaction Limits**: Limit the maximum value of transactions to reduce potential losses in case of an exploit.
   - **Cap Total Locked Value**: Set a ceiling on the amount of funds users can deposit.

3. **Controlled Access**
   - **Whitelist Early Users**: Restrict access to a small group of trusted participants or community members.
   - **Invite-Only Beta**: Use invitation codes to onboard users gradually.

4. **Gradual Expansion**
   - **Increase Limits Incrementally**: Slowly raise transaction and deposit caps as confidence in the system grows.
   - **Unlock Additional Features**: Enable more functionalities over time after thorough testing and validation.

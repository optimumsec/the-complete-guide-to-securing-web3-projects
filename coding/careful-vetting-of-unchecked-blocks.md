## Careful Vetting Of Unchecked Blocks

In Solidity 0.8.x, unchecked math operations are permitted within `unchecked` blocks, offering an opportunity for gas optimization in smart contracts. However, this feature also introduces risks of potential overflows and underflows, which can lead to significant vulnerabilities and unintended consequences. Consequently, the best practice is to prioritize safe math operations by default, resorting to `unchecked` blocks only when clear optimizations can be achieved. 

It is essential to meticulously vet and review these `unchecked` sections to ensure they do not compromise the safety and reliability of the contract. By adhering to this philosophy, developers can strike a balance between gas efficiency and robust security.

## Handling Communications Before a Smart Contract Upgrade

Effective communication before a smart contract upgrade is critical for maintaining user trust and ensuring smooth operations. The approach differs depending on whether the upgrade is a routine enhancement or an emergency security fix. Below are actionable guidelines for both scenarios.

### Routine Upgrade: Adding New Features  

When upgrading to introduce new features, the focus is on transparency, user readiness, and minimizing disruption.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Announce Early**  
   - Share the planned upgrade details well in advance through official channels (website, social media, email, etc.).  
   - Clearly state the purpose of the upgrade and the benefits it brings to users.  

2. **Reassure Users**  
   - Emphasize that all funds are safe during the upgrade.  
   - Provide clear instructions if any user action is required, such as pausing interactions or withdrawing funds temporarily.

3. **Communicate Downtime**  
   - Clearly outline the expected downtime, specifying the exact time and duration.  
   - Explain the impact on user interactions, such as halted transactions or disabled features.

4. **Encourage Community Feedback**  
   - Allow users to ask questions or raise concerns in advance to ensure they feel engaged and informed.

5. **Post-Upgrade Updates**  
   - Notify users once the upgrade is complete, summarizing the changes and reaffirming the safety of their assets.

### Emergency Upgrade: Fixing a Security Issue  

In the case of an urgent upgrade to resolve a security vulnerability, communication must be swift and focused, with a balance between transparency and discretion.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Act Quickly**  
   - Announce the need for immediate maintenance without disclosing sensitive details that could enable exploitation before the fix is implemented.  

2. **Reassure Users**  
   - Clearly state that funds are safe and the team is acting to enhance security.  
   - Avoid technical jargon; focus on user trust and the steps being taken to safeguard their assets.

3. **Explain Temporary Downtime**  
   - Provide an estimated timeline for the fix and any service interruptions.  
   - If the downtime is extended, provide periodic updates to reassure users of progress.

4. **Coordinate with Key Stakeholders**  
   - Inform trusted community leaders, partners, and validators (if applicable) about the issue to ensure alignment in messaging.

5. **Post-Upgrade Transparency**  
   - After resolving the issue, share a detailed post-mortem, explaining the vulnerability, the steps taken to address it, and any additional measures to prevent recurrence.  

6. **Encourage Security Reporting**  
   - Remind users and developers of the projectâ€™s bug bounty program or other mechanisms to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Avoid Vendoring Dependencies

Vendoring smart contracts or libraries—copying them directly into your project—can lead to significant risks, including:  

1. **Security Risks:** Vendored code doesn't automatically benefit from updates or security patches, leaving your project vulnerable.  
2. **Auditing Challenges:** Embedded dependencies are harder to track and audit, reducing transparency.  
3. **Upgradability Issues:** Vendoring locks you into outdated versions, making it difficult to adopt new features or fixes.  
4. **Increased Complexity:** Managing multiple vendored libraries adds unnecessary project overhead.

### Best Practice: Use Package Managers  
Leverage tools like **npm**, **yarn**, **Forge**, or **Hardhat** to manage dependencies efficiently. These tools ensure easy updates, version control, and compatibility, keeping your code secure and maintainable.

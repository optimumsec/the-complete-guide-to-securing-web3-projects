## Follow the EIP-712 Standard for Digital Signatures

[EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) defines a structured approach for signing typed data, which reduces the likelihood of signature-related vulnerabilities. By standardizing the format of signed messages, it allows users to review and verify the contents of their transaction more easily, helping to prevent phishing attacks and malicious contract interactions. 

The structured data hashing and signing outlined in EIP-712 also protect against replay attacks, where attackers attempt to reuse signatures in different contexts to exploit the system. Following this standard ensures that signatures are cryptographically bound to specific data structures, minimizing ambiguity in user intent and transaction details.

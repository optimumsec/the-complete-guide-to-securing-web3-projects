## Use The SafeCast Library

Down-casting in Solidity does not inherently trigger a revert on overflow, which can result in unexpected vulnerabilities or bugs. The [`SafeCast`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol) library mitigates this problem by ensuring that the transaction reverts whenever an overflow happens during these operations. 

By utilizing `SafeCast` in place of unchecked operations, developers can prevent a significant category of potential bugs, making it advisable for all Solidity developers to adopt this library as part of their coding standards.
